# OpenCrane Agent Guidance

## IAM-First

OpenCrane is IAM-first.

- Prefer federated identity, Workload Identity, OIDC, and cloud IAM over static bearer tokens.
- Treat bearer tokens as temporary compatibility shims or break-glass paths, not the default architecture.
- Every platform service and every tenant workload should have an explicit workload identity.
- Every human operator should authenticate through centrally managed identity, not shared long-lived tokens.

## Central Identity Model

Identity and authorization must be described centrally.

- Cloud IAM is the source of truth for cloud resource access.
- Kubernetes RBAC is the source of truth for Kubernetes API access.
- Terraform should define cloud identities, trust bindings, and IAM role attachments.
- Helm should define Kubernetes service accounts, RBAC bindings, and workload identity annotations.
- Application code should consume identity provided by the platform rather than inventing parallel auth schemes.

## Defaults

- New services should get a dedicated Kubernetes service account.
- New services should get a dedicated cloud service account when they need cloud API access.
- Disable service account token automount unless Kubernetes API access is explicitly required.
- Scope IAM and RBAC to the smallest role that satisfies the workload.
- Prefer machine-to-machine identity over shared secrets.

## Token Policy

- Do not introduce new bearer-token control paths when IAM or OIDC can solve the problem.
- Existing bearer-token paths should be treated as migration targets.
- If a bearer token is unavoidable, document why IAM cannot be used, constrain its scope, and define a removal path.

## OpenCrane-Specific Direction

- Tenant workloads should use per-tenant Workload Identity for cloud storage and other tenant-scoped cloud resources.
- Operator and control-plane services should move toward explicit workload identities instead of implicit cluster-only trust.
- Network reachability does not imply authorization; authorization should come from IAM and RBAC, not location on the cluster network.
